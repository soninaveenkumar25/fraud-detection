## Extended Description
- Performed exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand transaction patterns.
- Engineered features like transaction ratios and amount differences for better model performance.
- Handled missing values and scaled features using StandardScaler.
- Logistic Regression achieved 98% accuracy on test set; confusion matrix shows minimal false positives.
- Future improvements: explore Random Forest, XGBoost, and deploy as a real-time fraud detection API.
